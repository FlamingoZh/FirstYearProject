**Due to file size limit, the swav pretrained model, `intersection` folder, `sg_dataset` folder and glove embedding dict are not uploaded here. Please refer to Box to download them.**  

You can run `spearman.py` to calculate the spearman correlation of the perfect mapping of two systems.   

`swav_model/make_intersection.py` is used to generate intersection data (which are located in `swav_model/pkl_files/`).
